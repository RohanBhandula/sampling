# sampling
sampling_assignment_102003472
for balancing the dataset --> used undersampling
                          --> also tried oversampling









for sampling used 5 methods --> simple
                            --> startified
                            --> clustered
                            --> systematic
                            --> convenience
                            
                            
                            
                            
                    
                            
                            
                      
ML models --> Random forest 
          --> decision tree
          --> KNN
          --> Logistic
          --> SVC
